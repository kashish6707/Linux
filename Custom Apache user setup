## Create user "rose" with uid 1522 and designate the home directory as /var/www/rose
### UID stands for user identifier. It is a unique numerical value assigned to each user account. The system uses it to identify and differentiate between different user.
### The /etc/passwd file stores user account information. This file contains a list of all user accounts on the system, along with their corresponding UIDs, group IDs, home directories and login shells.
```
sudo cat /etc/passwd
```
